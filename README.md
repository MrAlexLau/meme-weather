## Weather... with memes!

Is looking up the weather simply too boring for you? Fear not, meme weather is here to spiff up your day.

## Development notes:
- Ruby version: 2.1
- Run tests with `rspec` - or if you prefer to use guard you can run `guard`, which will call the tests.
- Make sure the `OPEN_WEATHER_APP_ID` environment variable is set to an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/appid)
